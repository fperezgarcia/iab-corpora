I purchased it three years ago when it had 25,000 miles. Currently, it has 63,295 miles. I brought it to the dealership two weeks ago for a recall and told them about a noise I was hearing in the steering column. I was told that my transmission would need to be replaced. The planetary gears were completely destroyed and a new transmission was the only way to fix the problem. We wanted to bring it to our local mechanic but were told that because the transmission was apart, we couldn't drive it. </p><p>I called Chrysler to see if they would extend my warranty to cover this problem. They reviewed my case and declined to help because they said I did not replace transmission fluid at 30,000 and 60,000 miles and therefore made the warranty void. I have looked in all documentation from Chrysler and nowhere does it state that the transmission fluid needs to be replaced at 30,000 miles. We paid $4500 for a new transmission on a 2008 car. I am angry that Chrysler wouldn't give us anything towards this problem. In no way would the planetary gears be affected by replacing the transmission fluid or not. This is clearly a manufacturer issue and I, as the consumer, paid immensely for it.</p><ul class="review-actions"><li class="add-company-response"><a href="https://www.consumeraffairs.com/brands/?claim_campaign_id=14704">add your response</a></li></ul><span class="review-meta"><span class="feedback"><span class="text">Helpful?</span><a href="#" class="yes">Yes</a><a href="#" class="no">No</a></span></span></div></div></div><div class="review" id="review-600329" itemprop="review" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Review"><div class="review-post user-post complaint"><div class="post-info"><img src="http://static.consumeraffairs.com/img/common/user-pic-micro.b99ed0d778fc.png" class="author-pic" /><div class="post-author"><span class="author-name" itemprop="author">Terry of Florence, AZ</span> on <span class="post-date" content="2012-07-13 16:33:59" itemprop="datePublished">July 13, 2012</span></div><div class="review-rating updated-rating" itemtype="http://schema.org/Rating" itemscope itemprop="reviewRating"><span class="label">Satisfaction Rating</span><span class="star-container color-rating"><span class="stars rate-2"><span itemprop="ratingValue">2</span>/5</span></span></div></div><div class="post-content  complaint_content" itemprop="reviewBody"><p>In econo mode, the Chrysler transmission has a hard shifting point.

The transmission was covered under warranty, but we were kept waiting for two days for the repair. We were away from home, so we required food and lodging. I was by the Chrysler dealership making the repair that the expenses for our stay would be reimbursed by Chrysler Customer Care. I submitted all expenses (totaling $581.86) to Chrysler Customer Care on July 27, 2011 by certified mail, and was notified on August 8, 2011 by phone that my claim had been denied. When I asked to speak with a supervisor, I was told no one was available and that I'd be given a call back. The call never came; I followed up by phone for three days running and finally reached a supervisor today (8/10/11), who also told me the claim was denied.</p><ul class="review-actions"><li class="add-company-response"><a href="https://www.consumeraffairs.com/brands/?claim_campaign_id=14704">add your response</a></li></ul><span class="review-meta"><span class="feedback"><span class="text">Helpful?</span><a href="#" class="yes">Yes</a><a href="#" class="no">No</a></span></span></div></div></div><div class="review" id="review-268866" itemprop="review" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Review"><div class="review-post user-post complaint"><div class="post-info"><img src="http://static.consumeraffairs.com/img/common/user-pic-micro.b99ed0d778fc.png" class="author-pic" /><div class="post-author"><span class="author-name" itemprop="author">Nancy of Carmel, IN</span> on <span class="post-date" content="2000-11-29 12:45:35" itemprop="datePublished">Nov. 29, 2000</span></div></div><div class="post-content  complaint_content" itemprop="reviewBody"><p>I have a 1996 Dodge Grand Caravan with 57,000 miles.  While driving, the car started making a loud grinding noise and then died.  I am told by the local dealer (Palmer South in Indianapolis) that the entire transmission must be replaced at a cost of approximately $2000.  </p><p>My 1989 Chrysler minivan had two transmission replacements during the warranty period.  All Chrysler has done to improve its transmission is to make it last past the warranty period.  Jensen told me that it was my fault that I didn't purchase extended coverage.  I think that it is Chrysler's fault to make a defective product -- had it not been defective I would not have needed extended coverage to have it replaced.  Jensen refused to tell me what the life of a Chrysler transmission is and told me that nobody at Chrysler could tell me that.  </p><p>I think people deserve to know when they buy a Chrysler that the transmission is going to die and leave them stranded.  Jensen asked if I had the transmission service required by the owner's manual and whether I had the receipt.  I told him that I thought I did have the receipt.  After a long wait, he returned to the phone and said because I had no previous trouble with the transmission, because the A.T. service was not done at a Chrysler dealer and because I was out of warranty, I was out of luck.  From his canned response, it was evident that I am not the only one with this problem.  </p><p>Certainly we should expect a transmission to last longer than 57,000 miles.  How come non-Chrysler vehicles don't need transmission replacements?  The scary thing is that I now have a rebuilt transmission that probably failed on somebody else and somebody else will get my transmission! </p><ul class="review-actions"><li class="add-company-response"><a href="https://www.consumeraffairs.com/brands/?claim_campaign_id=14704">add your response</a></li></ul><span class="review-meta"><span class="feedback"><span class="text">Helpful?</span><a href="#" class="yes">Yes</a><a href="#" class="no">No</a></span></span></div></div></div><div class="review" id="review-268867" itemprop="review" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Review"><div class="review-post user-post complaint"><div class="post-info"><img src="http://static.consumeraffairs.com/img/common/user-pic-micro.b99ed0d778fc.png" class="author-pic" /><div class="post-author"><span class="author-name" itemprop="author">Kevin of Havre De Grace, MD</span> on <span class="post-date" content="2000-01-01 15:53:31" itemprop="datePublished">Jan. 1, 2000</span></div></div><div class="post-content  complaint_content" itemprop="reviewBody"><p>My complaint is against Chrysler Corp. as a whole.
