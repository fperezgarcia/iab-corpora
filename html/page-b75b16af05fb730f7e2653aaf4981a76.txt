<title>2012 Ford Focus 5-Door Hatchback (Titanium Edition) Review by Carey

    Focus has been a mainstay in Ford&#39;s worldwide passenger car lineup
    since its European debut in 1998. The North American market got that car
    in 1999, model year 2000. Ford here was all about SUVs at that time, and
    the compact, efficient Focus provided some balance for CAFE fuel economy
    ratings and also made people looking for a small, efficient, and fun car
    happy. A model range that originally included hatchbacks, sedans, and
    wagons with a variety of engines from economy to SVT high-performance
    spec, and chassis to match, made the Focus a success. There was
    considerable divergence between North America and the rest of the world

<p><i><b>DRIVING DOWN THE ROAD WITH CAREY RUSS</i></b></p>

<br>


<p>The Focus has been a mainstay in Ford's worldwide passenger car lineup
since its European debut in 1998. The North American market got that car in
1999, model year 2000. Ford here was all about SUVs at that time, and the
compact, efficient Focus provided some balance for CAFE fuel economy
ratings and also made people looking for a small, efficient, and fun car
happy. A model range that originally included hatchbacks, sedans, and
wagons with a variety of engines from economy to SVT high-performance spec,
and chassis to match, made the Focus a success.</p>


<p>There was considerable divergence between North America and the rest of
the world when it was time for the second generation in 2005. As in we
didn't get it until 2008 and then it was a very different car from what was
available elsewhere. No hatchback or wagon here, either. Small cars weren't
selling well -- until the economy faltered and fuel prices rose.</p>


<p>There was another development at Ford around that time as well -- a new
CEO. Alan Mulally was previously with Boeing, which sold the same aircraft
worldwide. Subject to minor customer-preference details, a 737 sold to a
domestic carrier is the same as one sold to a European or Asian airline.
Mulally was shocked that the auto industry was very different.</p>


<p>The consumer automotive market is not the commercial aircraft market,
but Mulally did have a point. One car, worldwide, is less expensive to
develop and manufacture. And American preferences have changed over the
years, with an increasing number of people preferring smaller, more
economical cars, with a bonus for cars that actually handle well and are
fun to drive.</p>


<p>All of which meant that when the third-generation Focus debuted for
model year 2012 (2011 introduction), we got the same car as did Europe,
with only minor differences due to differing safety and emissions
regulations. We didn't get the wagon -- Americans still don't understand
small wagons -- but did get the sedan and five-door (four plus hatch)
hatchback. Drivetrains are the same - a 2.0-liter, 160-horsepower four with
direct fuel injection driving the front wheels through either a five-speed
manual or six-speed "PowerShift" dual-clutch automated manual transmission.
And the chassis tuning is nearly identical as well, even though our Focuses
(Foci?) are from Wayne MI, not Europe.</p>

<p>Trim levels are S, SE, SEL, and Titanium, starting with good basics in
the S and adding standard and optional features until the near-luxury
Titanium is reached. As is increasingly common, the hatchback is positioned
above the sedan, and for that reason not offered at S level. I drove an SE
sedan with the SE Sport Package and manual transmission earlier in the year
and was quite impressed. As is typical, the mid-level SE is the heart of
the line, and can be outfitted from econo-commuter to budget sporty fun,
with that one definitely on the fun side. Last week I had the top-of-the
line Titanium for a test car, in hatchback form with the PowerShift
transmission. With (optional) leather seating and all of Ford's current
cabin electronic tech goodies -- Sync, myFord Touch, Sirius satellite
radio, and an SD card-based navigation system -- it represented the luxury
aspect of the Focus, although with the Sport package for a more European
experience. The hatch offers more interior storage and versatility in a
slightly shorter package, but in any form Ford's newest Focus is one of the
best cars in the compact segment, from anywhere in the world.</p>

<iframe width="480" height="299" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/-JT2RUN3lYY" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
<br><br>

<p><b>APPEARANCE:</b> The look of Ford's latest small cars is distinctive,
identifiable, and very European. Like the smaller Fiesta, the Focus's
styling is visually interestingly but cohesive, with flowing sculpted lines
and a long passenger cabin with well-raked windshield and backlight, even
on the hatchback. Close inspection reveals that the popular oversized
grille is mostly blacked-out body paneling, with small upper and lower
openings. Look under the front of the car and find careful attention to
underbody aerodynamics in panelling beneath the front and rubber air dams
in front of all wheels. That's functional more than for style, and works as
the Focus is quiet and stable at all speeds, even on the highway in strong
crosswinds.</p>


<p><b>COMFORT:</b> A nearly two-inch growth in wheelbase and completely redesigned
interior mean that there's more room inside, for both front and rear
passengers. While some competitors have de-contented their compact
offerings, Ford has gone in the opposite direction. Soft-touch materials
are used on most interior surfaces. Windshield glass has an acoustic
control layer to reduce noise coming into the cabin, and thicker side and
rear glass further reduces interior noise levels. All models feature a
steering wheel manually-adjustable for both tilt and reach; in higher-level
models the rim is leather-wrapped for comfort. If in the lower trim levels
the 2012 Focus is a cut above the norm in interior materials and attention
to detail, it attempts to take on the luxury compacts at Titanium level,
especially with the Premium Package. The front seats are very good, with
firm, supportive padding and reasonable bolstering. Leather seating
surfaces and a power-adjustable driver's seat are part of the Titanium
Premium Package. </p>

<p>Power windows and air conditioning are standard in all
models, with upper levels getting dual-zone automatic climate control.
Instrumentation is complete and presented well, with main instruments and
trip information under a hood in front of the driver. The MyFord Touch
"glass cockpit" touch-screen at the top of the center stack controls audio,
phone, and navigation systems, replacing multiple hard buttons with
context-sensitive soft buttons and smartphone/audio player-like external
controls. Climate control is thankfully separate, a simple analog system
lower in the stack. Audio choices at this level are everything - AM, FM,
and Sirius radio, CDs in all popular formats, and USB and A/V inputs.
Useful storage spaces abound in the cabin. The rear seat offers good
accommodation for two, or occasionally three mid-sized adults. Here it's
split 60/40 for maximum versatility, with great access via rear doors and
the large hatch. A real spare tire can be found under the rear load floor,
no can of sealant thank you very much.</p>


<p><b>SAFETY:</b> The newest Focus was designed and built to meet or exceed
worldwide crashworthiness standards for the foreseeable future. Its unibody
structure is built with extensive use of high-strength steel for strength
and light weight. Over 31 percent of the structure is made of ultra-high
strength and boron steel for further weight reduction and strength and
rigidity increase.</p>


<p><b>RIDE AND HANDLING:</b> Only the Focus name remains the same. The new unibody
structure contributes as much to road manners as it does to safety, and the
2012 Focus is a very enjoyable car to drive. Suspension is fully
independent, with MacPherson struts in front and the "Control Blade"
multilink system in the rear. The Titanium Sport Package upgrades wheels
and tires to P235/40 ZR18s on alloy rims and adds firmer springs and
dampers. No complaints. Despite the low-profile tires, the ride quality is
still very good, if appropriately firm. The higher trim levels replace the
rear drums found in lesser models with discs, a worthwhile improvement. The
electrically-assisted steering has a moderate touch and much better road
feel than most other EPS systems. The Focus is great fun on a twisty back
road and comfortable on the highway or in town. Torque vectoring via the
ABS/traction control system helps emulate a limited-slip differential to
better get power to the ground, and to reduce understeer in corners.</p>


<p><b>PERFORMANCE:</b> As good as the chassis is, Ford's best improvement to the
Focus is under the hood. The 2.0-liter aluminum alloy inline four makes 160
horsepower (at 6500 rpm) and 146 lb-ft of torque (at 4450 rpm), 20 more
horses and with a ten percent improvement in fuel economy. More is less?
Yes - direct fuel injection allows a higher compression ratio -- 12.0:1
here, and on unleaded regular at that -- which increases both torque (and
therefore horsepower) and fuel efficiency. "Twin independent variable
camshaft timing" (Ti-VCT), Ford's term for dual cam phasing, further
contributes to a broad torque spread, efficiency, and lower emissions. With
the twin-clutch automated-manual "PowerShift" transmission, shifting is
optimized for fuel efficiency, choosing the highest gear possible for any
given situation. This is less an issue than it may seem because of the
engine's good low-rpm torque, and Sport mode keeps it in a lower gear, with
manual shifting possible. That's by a strange little rocker switch on the
shift lever, which gives me the message "let the computer do it". The
computer does a good job, with shifts tending to be slower and smoother
than more performance-oriented dual-clutch implementations. Fuel economy is
good for the car's size, high 20s around town and high 30s on the highway,
even over 40 in some instances.</p>


<p><b>CONCLUSIONS:</b> Small American car that's international in flavor with good
looks, fun performance, a low appetite for fuel, and lots of room inside?
Must be a new Ford Focus.</p>

<p><b>Sidebar: Ford Automated Parking</b><br>

You can get a new Focus with Ford's Active Parking Technology active
parking system. Do you need it? Probably not, but it does do an admirable
job of parallel parking, with some restrictions. It cuts closer to both
other cars and curbs that I would, but then I can't see those as well from
the windshield and mirrors, or even rearview camera, as can the systems
sensors. It doesn't work in simple situations -- it needs a reference
vehicle, and a space considerably longer than the car, in order to work.
But work it does -- pull up next to the vehicle in front of the desired
space, and if that space meets with computer approval, a message will flash
on the screen at the top of the center stack. Then take your hand off the
steering wheel and let the computer take over. You still do control the
brakes and throttle, though, so pay attention.</p>


<p>It's not a necessity by any means, but it is just the thing for the
committed gadget fan to use to impress and amaze passengers.</p>
