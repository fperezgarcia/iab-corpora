  <h3>New York Klezmer Orchestra</h3>
  <p>At the turn of the last century,  the sounds of klezmer reverberated through the Lower East Side of New York  City. Brought to America by Eastern Europeans, the jubilant music of their  beloved <em>shtetls</em> became intertwined  with new American jazz syncopations. NYKO goes one step further by adding rock  and swing influences for a fun, buoyant night of music. </p>

  <h2>September 12 </h2><img alt=' ' src="calimage/13-14/image004.jpg" align="right" />
  <h3>Stage Whispers:<br />Conversations with Theatre Professionals</h3>
  As part of the  Department of Theatre and Music Studies' alliance with Geva Theatre Center,  this series of interactive panels allows attendees to discover various aspects of making theatre.<p>
 In a healthy dose of happenstance, <em>Almost, Maine</em> playwright John Cariani will appear as the initial guest at this years "Stage Whispers: Conversations with Theatre Professionals" series three weeks prior to the opening of that play at The College at Brockports Tower Fine Arts Center Mainstage. Cariani will speak about the mythical, mystical Northeast town where several of his plays take place, his transition from actor to playwright and the pre-production process for his play, <em>Last Gas</em>, which will be seen later this season at Geva Theatre Center. "Stage Whispers" takes place on Thursday, September 12, 2013, at 10 am, in the Colleges Tower Fine Arts Center Black Box Theatre, 180 Holley Street. The talk is free and open to the public.</p> 

Cariani, who was nominated for a Tony Award® for his performance in the most recent Broadway revival of <em>Fiddler on the Roof</em>, has also appeared in many television series, including his recurring appearances as Beck on <em>Law and Order: Criminal Intent</em>, and in several feature films, including <em>Kissing Jessica Stein</em>. His evolution from onstage to offstage artist stemmed from what he considered a dearth of decent audition material for men. So he took it upon himself to create his own. That audition piece begat a series of monologues that were presented at an NBC-sponsored event for budding playwrights. Eventually, he realized that some of the monologues (which had numbered more than 20 at the time) were thematically related, drew on his childhood in Presque Isle, ME, and were all a bit fantastical. In their review of <em>Almost, Maine</em>, <em>The New York Times</em> indicated that Cariani is working from the notion that the remoter expanses of the country are the natural harbor of the adorably lovelorn, the touched and the irretrievably lost.<p>

The Stage Whispers series is sponsored by The College at Brockports Department of Theatre and Music Studies in conjunction with their educational partnership with Geva Theatre Center. The series gives community members insight into the process of professional theatre artists. For more information, please call (585) 395-2787.</p>

  <h3>Almost, Maine</h3>by John Cariani
  <p>&ldquo;A whimsical approach to the joys and perils of romance.&rdquo; &ndash; <em>The New York Times</em></p>
  <p>On a cold, clear winter&rsquo;s night, the residents of Almost, Maine, find  themselves falling in and out of love in unexpected and often hilarious ways.  Similar in structure to the department&rsquo;s <em>Festival of Ten</em>, the eight  interconnected vignettes allow us to take a look at the poignancy of  relationships. </p>

  Amy Cheng:<em> Irrational Exuberance</em></h3>
  <p>
  The basic principle of  assembly-line manufacturing is providing the correct recipe and environment.  With those elements, one could construct a computer or other complex machine.  In the series <em>Life Industries</em>, Andrew  Au imagines an industrial plant that manufactures and markets living things,  the necessary construction being merely code that explains a sequence of events  to make the organism viable. The series includes  paintings, prints, sculpture and a mockumentary about the inner workings inside  Life Industries.</p>
  <p>In<em> Irrational Exuberance, </em>Amy  Cheng brings together a new series of sumptuously intricate ornamental  paintings. Loosely anchored on the notion of the mandala, the paintings are  richly referential: they call to mind the cosmos, cells, lace, brocade and  more. Cheng aligns herself with the long tradition of geometric and floral  patterns which the Far East, the Middle East, the Byzantine and the Baroque  have long employed.</p>

 <h3>bobrauschenbergamerica</h3><p> by Charles L. Mee<br />
  &ldquo;&hellip;brashly,  unapologetically entertaining.&rdquo; &ndash; <em>The New  York Times</em></p>
  <p>Bob  Rauschenberg&rsquo;s &ldquo;combines&rdquo; are famous for assembling found objects into art. <em>bobrauschenbergamerica</em> is similar in  that it is not a direct biography of the artist but a collection of a different  type: simple moments of simple lives captured as the artist himself might have  done. The play &mdash; at times both comic and touching &mdash; reminds us that, &ldquo;like art,  there are no rules here.&rdquo; But there are an awful lot of chicken jokes.</p>

The oratorio,  based on texts from as early as the 11th century, deals with typical themes of  springtime &mdash; love, lust and other indulgences. <em>Carmina Burana</em> is one of the most popular musical works of the 20th  century, crossing over from the concert hall to its use in advertising and  popular movies. </p>
