New York is certainly the mecca of all things Broadway. However, many major cities and metro regions across the United States have ornate play houses that host the hottest Broadway plays. It used to be that to see quality arts you had to be in New York City, but no more. Opera, ballet, musicals, productions and the works are seen across the country, making it more accessible to fans of Broadway... and their husbands.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="text-align: justify;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="text-align: justify;"&gt;Yes, that's right, their husbands. To be sure, not all husbands or men are fanatically against attending Broadway plays, in fact we all enjoy it equally. It does seem, however, that stubborn men, and especially husbands, protest the most when it comes to accompanying their wives to a musical of any sort. At least, this is the stereotype or stigma that goes along with a 'macho' man. So, ladies, how can you convince, bribe, encourage or drag your man to a play and help him actually enjoy himself? Here are a few tips:&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="text-align: justify;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="text-align: justify;"&gt;Find Some Action: Choose a drama or action infused production or play. Les Miserables is a great play with some war scenes, fighting, explosions and the works. With such intense action, he may not mind the musical aspect and in fact, he may find it adds to the experience. Ask him to think of it as the soundtrack to his favorite war movie.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="text-align: justify;"&gt;Surprise Him: Make all the arrangements and include arts, entertainment and food and surprise him for the evening. Plan dinner or even a weekend getaway.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="text-align: justify;"&gt;Make A Deal: Offer to do something he enjoys or give him some space to enjoy the things he loves in return for taking you out so that he sees this is a give-and-take deal.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="text-align: justify;"&gt;Make It An Event: If he likes going to dinner and dancing, then get dressed up an have dinner, see the Broadway play and go dancing. Combining the evening with things you both enjoy will draw out the fun for both of you.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="text-align: justify;"&gt;The More The Merrier: Invite your couple friends to join you. Your man will be more comfortable around a group of guys he knows and your gal friends will be excited to get out too.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="text-align: justify;"&gt;Give A Little: The best relationships are those with two-way streets - meaning, if you're asking him to give the arts a try, make an honest effort to enjoy things he does. Perhaps this means you don a football jersey and watch a game on Sunday, but who knows, you may get in to the spirit of the game and enjoy yourself. Showing him that you are meeting him in the middle will make him want to do the same for you.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="text-align: justify;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="text-align: justify;"&gt;These tips are geared towards the arts but can really be applied to anything you want to get your spouse interested in. The best way to encourage someone to enjoy the arts is to do just that - encourage them with positive reinforcement and never negative or nagging words. Encourage and discover with them which plays, productions or musicals they enjoy and what parts they love the most. Was it the music, the storyline, the special affects, set, props and wardrobe - all of these are magnificent when you are experiencing them from the audience of one of America's fabulous theatres.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="text-align: justify;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="text-align: justify;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://tenwomengallery.blogspot.com/feeds/7387069231636424945/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://tenwomengallery.blogspot.com/2012/08/arts-and-entertainment-getting-your-man.html#comment-form' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/4351290424536232585/posts/default/7387069231636424945'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/4351290424536232585/posts/default/7387069231636424945'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://tenwomengallery.blogspot.com/2012/08/arts-and-entertainment-getting-your-man.html' title='Arts and Entertainment - Getting Your Man to Appreciate Theater'/><author><name>momingsite</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/15573422267490118045</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='http://img2.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-4351290424536232585.post-508452074483389338</id><published>2012-08-05T13:51:00.002-07:00</published><updated>2012-08-05T13:51:52.479-07:00</updated><title type='text'>Humor Can Be Entertaining When Exercising the Art of Entertainment</title><content type='html'>&lt;div style="text-align: justify;"&gt;In most groups, the art of entertainment points to a special person. It is indeed an honor to be labeled the entertainer. Entertainment should be directed toward good humor. The comedian, whether famous or a want-to-be, should never use ridicule as part of their message. The later can sometime be tragic; because no doubt, someone will eventually be hurt due to the fact: Loose lips can sink ships.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="text-align: justify;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="text-align: justify;"&gt;If you are an entertainer that enjoys the art of good humor, you should try to be certain that the jovial happening that you are spreading in not due to a negative incident. And I suggest that you must be aware as to how that individual will react if they learn that their antic is the subject of laughter. Sometime fun can become hilarious when it is approached with good taste, well meaning wit, and in the mode of decent pleasure. Yet, on the other hand, it can turn bad and become a disaster which may never heal, thus will leave hurt feelings.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="text-align: justify;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="text-align: justify;"&gt;It is best when one directs the laughter toward oneself, especially if ridicule, even in good taste, is involved. Everyone enjoys a good laugh with the person who is telling the story on them self, especially if they can laugh at them self with others. After all, often times comedians will get their material from a personal observation.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="text-align: justify;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="text-align: justify;"&gt;When offering good humor, the art of entertainment is often times best received when the entertainer projects them self as a different person while the laughter is being projected. Sometime a comedian will use a puppet, or they can dress-up as a clown, or maybe a man dressed as a woman, or an easy act is to change their voice for the moment. Whatever the presentation, the final result is in hopes of being funny.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="text-align: justify;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="text-align: justify;"&gt;It is not necessary to tell a comedian that he or she is funny, the reaction of the audience will depict the final judgment.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="text-align: justify;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="text-align: justify;"&gt;It is my pleasure to write for you and I sincerely hope you will enjoy my writings. I am new to this online business adventure. It has been stressful for me at times, but I stop, walk away, and relax. Then when I return to my computer I am energized with a new challenge.

The arts and entertainment district of Dallas is one of the most eclectic, giving birth to many southern jazz and blues sensations, as well as many local entertainers and bands of Dallas. Deep Ellum is known for its influence in the lifestyles of the artists of Dallas, bringing these groups the affordable lifestyle that is desired within Texas.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="text-align: justify;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="text-align: justify;"&gt;The neighborhood was originally founded in 1873 as the warehouse district, with the first factory belonging to Robert S. Munger. As time went on, there was further development including a Ford assembly plant manufactured during 1913 by Henry Ford. By the 60's and 70's, the area was mostly for industrial and warehousing, quickly taking a turn towards the more eclectic nature of Dallas.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="text-align: justify;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="text-align: justify;"&gt;The attention of Deep Ellum was enhanced as artists within the city begin to find the area a prime real estate section for acquiring New York style loft homes for a low price. The 1980's brought forth further development in the area, including upgrades to make way for a more populated area and more desirable within the city. By the end of the 80's, there were several night clubs in the area, with many residents finding the loft style homes to be quite attractive and new-age.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="text-align: justify;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="text-align: justify;"&gt;Today, Deep Ellum is part residential, part entertainment, offering a great refuge for artists and those seeking the more studio style modern living quarters of professionals and couples. The area still attracts a very eclectic crowd, with a population of 825 residents over a little more than half a square mile. The area now features different types of homes as well, including detached homes which can be found for a median cost of around $36,000, lofts and multi-family structures costing an average around $400,000, and condos reaching around $150,000.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="text-align: justify;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="text-align: justify;"&gt;The area is now home to many people who enjoy the busy lifestyle of Dallas, enjoying the artistic edge of the area. The neighborhood is also home to some of the most unique and original shopping destinations within the large city, claiming many tourists year round. There have been many famous artists traveling through and residing within Deep Ellum, with a reputation for housing some of the greats of history's music fame, bringing forth some of the greats of the current industry as well.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="text-align: justify;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="text-align: justify;"&gt;Although not a historic residential spot, the area has formed from historical relevance in warehousing and industrial markets to a place that many people reside in, finding great comfort in the busy area. The area is known for its arts and many eclectic members, which all contribute to the culture and characteristics of the neighborhood which seem to outshine many other Dallas neighborhoods. There are so many reasons to live in Dallas, with the arts and entertainment district being a prime location for those that are looking for some artistic inspiration where they lay their head each night&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="text-align: justify;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="text-align: justify;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://tenwomengallery.blogspot.com/feeds/8918009891394414964/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://tenwomengallery.blogspot.com/2012/08/living-around-arts-and-entertainment-of.html#comment-form' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/4351290424536232585/posts/default/8918009891394414964'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/4351290424536232585/posts/default/8918009891394414964'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://tenwomengallery.blogspot.com/2012/08/living-around-arts-and-entertainment-of.html' title='Living Around the Arts and Entertainment of Dallas, Texas in Deep Ellum'/><author><name>momingsite</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/15573422267490118045</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='http://img2.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-4351290424536232585.post-1740767174084256117</id><published>2010-12-29T13:10:00.000-08:00</published><updated>2012-08-05T13:47:58.887-07:00</updated><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='zebra plates'/><title type='text'>Simple Zebra Tablescape</title><content type='html'>When I saw this tapestry fabric yesterday, I immediately thought of my zebra salad plates --see&amp;nbsp;the plate&amp;nbsp;in the right hand corner?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_dWJRDkbpb1s/TRucH9X7hoI/AAAAAAAAM4A/vq4ANfANook/s1600/zebra+tapestry+fabric+x+%2528Medium%2529.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" closure_uid_x2il8q="157" height="542" n4="true" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_dWJRDkbpb1s/TRucH9X7hoI/AAAAAAAAM4A/vq4ANfANook/s640/zebra+tapestry+fabric+x+%2528Medium%2529.jpg" width="640" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After 4 hours of sewing and about 20 minutes to set the table, I ended up with a totally new look for my dining room:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_dWJRDkbpb1s/TRufQE2XjzI/AAAAAAAAM4M/SPHr9h6KoCs/s1600/zebra+tablescape+3+chairs+%2528Large%2529.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="480" n4="true" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_dWJRDkbpb1s/TRufQE2XjzI/AAAAAAAAM4M/SPHr9h6KoCs/s640/zebra+tablescape+3+chairs+%2528Large%2529.JPG" width="640" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&amp;nbsp;I made six chair covers to match the plates. They also go nicely with the new green color that we painted the dining room this fall.&amp;nbsp; I immediatley set a quick&amp;nbsp;table so I could see how it would look.&amp;nbsp; I really like the chair covers!&amp;nbsp; I am always thrilled when I spend hours making something and I actually like the finished product.&amp;nbsp; So often, that is NOT the case.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_dWJRDkbpb1s/TRufTZuzrHI/AAAAAAAAM4Q/dTRhgRvWpps/s1600/zebra+green+napkins+xxx+%2528Large%2529.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="640" n4="true" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_dWJRDkbpb1s/TRufTZuzrHI/AAAAAAAAM4Q/dTRhgRvWpps/s640/zebra+green+napkins+xxx+%2528Large%2529.JPG" width="482" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I even got to use my blah pea-soup-green napkins--they rarely go with any table.

So please stop by later this week to see what I do with these dishes.&amp;nbsp;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://tenwomengallery.blogspot.com/feeds/9032404399425137981/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://tenwomengallery.blogspot.com/2011/04/mikasa-leopard-dishes.html#comment-form' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/4351290424536232585/posts/default/9032404399425137981'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/4351290424536232585/posts/default/9032404399425137981'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://tenwomengallery.blogspot.com/2011/04/mikasa-leopard-dishes.html' title='Mikasa Leopard Dishes'/><author><name>momingsite</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/15573422267490118045</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='http://img2.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif'/></author><media:thumbnail xmlns:media='http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/' url='http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-0ROM1YjXNBk/TbSEAC_x62I/AAAAAAAANVM/S8elECdbRWU/s72-c/mikasa+leopard+dishes+arrived+%2528Medium%2529.JPG' height='72' width='72'/><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-4351290424536232585.post-8675446731358146668</id><published>2011-02-21T13:25:00.000-08:00</published><updated>2012-08-05T13:47:58.886-07:00</updated><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Red and Black Tablescapes'/><title type='text'>Black &amp; Red Polka Dot Tablescape</title><content type='html'>&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-gtI7PGsGGMw/TWLNwMtdwNI/AAAAAAAANDo/ysfMCvYrEc8/s1600/d%2Bplate.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="200" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-gtI7PGsGGMw/TWLNwMtdwNI/AAAAAAAANDo/ysfMCvYrEc8/s200/d%2Bplate.jpg" width="169" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here is another table that combines my two hobbies of quilting and table setting.&amp;nbsp; I made six of these quilt blocks called Dresden Plate -- so fitting for what I am using them for!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They are often made in pastels and usually sewn into a quilt like the one on the left (picture came from &lt;a href="http://www.patternsfromhistory.com/colonial_revival/dresden-plate.htm"&gt;this site&lt;/a&gt; on quilt history).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The ones I made are far from pastel and I decided to use mine for place mat/chargers to start a table in red and black.

However, in &lt;a href="http://sweetpea-labellavie.blogspot.com/2011/09/in-anticipation-of-fall.html"&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: #741b47;"&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;post I really have been anticipating a wonderful Fall season and getting the house ready for "cozying in".&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-XIYiYqpWClY/TpHXOVbZHxI/AAAAAAAACbQ/11R1zi4wtrk/s1600/GRANITE-EMMY-CUSHIONS+018.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="510" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-XIYiYqpWClY/TpHXOVbZHxI/AAAAAAAACbQ/11R1zi4wtrk/s640/GRANITE-EMMY-CUSHIONS+018.JPG" width="640" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;"&gt;So in anticipation of that, I've been working on what turned out to be a huge project! A few months ago I got a new (plaid) ottoman and recliner for our family room that you see below.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-0Ko9YIK0uo8/TpHXKSDtoHI/AAAAAAAACbM/1hA8Bp1kMqI/s1600/chair+ottoman+tree+037.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="480" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-0Ko9YIK0uo8/TpHXKSDtoHI/AAAAAAAACbM/1hA8Bp1kMqI/s640/chair+ottoman+tree+037.JPG" width="640" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;"&gt;the plaid fabric in the ottoman and pillows actually has the same sage green in it that my sectional is, however its difficult to see in these pictures...&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-oZP1fFtxN20/TpHoXgf7jdI/AAAAAAAACbk/8faKvj4gCQ0/s1600/chair+ottoman+tree+030.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="480" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-oZP1fFtxN20/TpHoXgf7jdI/AAAAAAAACbk/8faKvj4gCQ0/s640/chair+ottoman+tree+030.JPG" width="640" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;"&gt;I also had a plaid lumbar pillow made from the same fabric to sort of pull the room together.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;"&gt;But once everything was in place, I soon realized, my wicker table and chairs in my kitchen nook looked awful. You can see the old pink cushion below and just how bad it looked with the new plaid...&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-hyHfAteWj1I/TpHWetM8IiI/AAAAAAAACaw/-fME5_KmJEM/s1600/Candlewick+and+Cushions+017.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="480" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-hyHfAteWj1I/TpHWetM8IiI/AAAAAAAACaw/-fME5_KmJEM/s640/Candlewick+and+Cushions+017.JPG" width="640" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;"&gt;So I ordered the same plaid fabric that's on the ottoman (by-the yard) and decided to make new cushions which turned out to be harder than I thought; upholstery fabric is difficult to sew on a home machine but it was worth it in the end.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both;

text-align: left;"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;"&gt;numbered each one because in reality, each cushion is just a bit different in size from the factory so in order to make sure the new covers fit well, I wanted to keep the right cushion with the right cover.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both;

You won't find me working all week on a table.&amp;nbsp; As an empty-nester, I only have to set weekday tables for two (sometimes only one).&amp;nbsp; Even my more elaborate guest tables are less than one hour.&amp;nbsp; I have too many other things to do and I bet you do, too!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But just because we lead busy lives, does not mean we have to sacrifice a nice dinner table.&amp;nbsp; I already had this bright parrot tulip centerpiece on the table.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-xH9F8_csEMY/TdarnBWC9hI/AAAAAAAANbw/9DtdL3VQeNI/s1600/100_8462+%2528Medium%2529.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="622" j8="true" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-xH9F8_csEMY/TdarnBWC9hI/AAAAAAAANbw/9DtdL3VQeNI/s640/100_8462+%2528Medium%2529.JPG" width="640" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;All I had to do to complete the dinner setting was find some matching dishes.&amp;nbsp;Since the flowers were in a cobalt blue vase,&amp;nbsp;it was an easy choice--&amp;nbsp;cobalt blue dinner plates.
