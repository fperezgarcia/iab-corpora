"It is everything everyone always wanted in a minivan, plus cool."</p><p class="Text-TextBody HoustonText" id="id2427899">Recently the <a href="/?controllerName=search&action=search&channel=life&search=1&inlineLink=1&query=%22Wall+Street+Journal%22">Wall Street Journal</a> reported that the folks at Chrysler were planning to add some more man to the van when it rolls out its 2011 Dodge Grand Caravan.</p><p class="Text-TextBody HoustonText" id="id2427904">E-mail from a company representative said that a makeover was expected for the Grand Caravan and the <a href="/?controllerName=search&action=search&channel=life&search=1&inlineLink=1&query=%22Chrysler+Town%22">Chrysler Town</a> &amp; Country but that "it is too early for us to talk about what will go into marketing the new minivan."</p><p class="Text-TextBody HoustonText" id="id2427906">Honda releases the 2011 Odyssey, the country's top seller, in the fall.

"I think most of our competitors in the market agree."</p><p class="Text-TextBody HoustonText" id="id2419373">The attempt at both was part of the Odyssey's marketing campaign for its last iteration of the Odyssey, the <span class="Text-TextBody HoustonText Italic"><em class="Text-TextBody HoustonText Italic">Respect the Van</em></span> marketing plan.</p><p class="Text-TextBody HoustonText" id="id2428469">If not exactly testosterone-fueled, the idea was to make sure the world was giving the van its props. After all, a family shouldn't take for granted its minivan just because it carts the kids and the groceries.</p><p class="Text-TextBody HoustonText" id="id2430147">As part of that campaign, Honda produced a funk-themed commercial now available on YouTube that announced: <span class="Text-TextBody HoustonText Italic"><em class="Text-TextBody HoustonText Italic">The Van is Back</em></span>. With some lava-lamp lighting and help from the George Clinton P-Funk classic <span class="Text-TextBody HoustonText Italic"><em class="Text-TextBody HoustonText Italic">Give Up the Funk</em></span>, the minivan seemed to get its groove back.</p><p class="Text-TextBody HoustonText" id="id2422502">"Vans have always had, throughout history, this dual role," Pines said.</p><p class="Text-TextBody HoustonText" id="id2422506">"Our point was, respect the van, man," she added. "Look where it's been."</p><p class="Text-TextBody HoustonText" id="id2422509">The van may have hit its funky high point in the 1970s. But the history of the family mobile, expected to perform multiple roles, goes back <span class="Text-TextBody HoustonText Regular">to <a href="/?controllerName=search&action=search&channel=life&search=1&inlineLink=1&query=%22Henry+Ford%22">Henry Ford</a>, who expected his original motor car to be</span> something that farmers could use, said <a href="/?controllerName=search&action=search&channel=life&search=1&inlineLink=1&query=%22Peter+D.+Norton%22">Peter D. Norton</a>, assistant professor at the <a href="/?controllerName=search&action=search&channel=life&search=1&inlineLink=1&query=%22University+of+Virginia%22">University of Virginia</a> and author of <span class="Text-TextBody HoustonText Italic"><em class="Text-TextBody HoustonText Italic">Fighting Traffic: The Dawn of the Motor Age in the American City</em></span>.</p><p class="Text-TextBody HoustonText" id="id2432134">From there, the large sedan was meant to fit the growing family in the early baby-boom years. The station wagon became the ultimate functional car for the growing family in the growing suburbs of the 1950s, said <a href="/?controllerName=search&action=search&channel=life&search=1&inlineLink=1&query=%22David+N.+Lucsko%22">David N. Lucsko</a>, assistant professor of history at <a href="/?controllerName=search&action=search&channel=life&search=1&inlineLink=1&query=%22Auburn+University%22">Auburn University</a> and author of <span class="Text-TextBody HoustonText Italic"><em class="Text-TextBody HoustonText Italic">The Business of Speed: The Hot Rod Industry in America 1915-1990</em></span>.</p><p class="Text-TextBody HoustonText" id="id2432227">For a while, many sedans had a wagon version, Lucsko said. Classics included the <a href="/?controllerName=search&action=search&channel=life&search=1&inlineLink=1&query=%22Chevy+Nomad%22">Chevy Nomad</a> of the 1950s and '60s and the Oldsmobile Vista Cruiser in the '60s and '70s.</p><p class="Text-TextBody HoustonText" id="id2432232">The station wagon died out in the 1990s. For example, Honda's last wagon was in the model year 1996, Price said.</p><p class="Text-TextBody HoustonText" id="id2432264">The tradition turned to the minivan in the 1980s. At least that's the way Chrysler sees it.</p><p class="Text-TextBody HoustonText" id="id2432299">Some might look to the VW bus or the <span class="Text-TextBody HoustonText Regular">Renault Espace</span> as the first minivan<span class="Text-TextBody HoustonText Regular">,</span> Lucsko said. But Chrysler claims that with the Dodge Caravan and the Plymouth Voyager, introduced in November 1983, it invented the modern minivan formula that remains on the roads today.</p><p class="Text-TextBody HoustonText" id="id2433307">The idea was to combine the station wagon and the van into a front-wheel-drive vehicle that drove like a car and would fit in the garage. The original Caravan was touted in an ad from the time as a "transportation revolution."</p><p class="Text-TextBody HoustonText" id="id2433342">The marketing of the minivan, Norton <span class="Text-TextBody HoustonText Regular">said, represents a historic conundrum for the</span> auto industry: How to sell a vehicle to a family with the multiple needs and desires of men and women.</p><p class="Text-TextBody HoustonText" id="id2433403">"You hope actually that the family will buy two cars," he said. "Until recently, the two-car family was the exception, not the rule."</p><p class="Text-TextBody HoustonText" id="id2433408">The efforts reach back to 1912, when The Detroit Electric set its sights on women with an electric car that was easier and cleaner to operate than the gasoline car, Norton said.</p><p class="Text-TextBody HoustonText" id="id2433413">In modern days, cars marketed to men, especially the SUV, have played on a rugged theme with Cherokees, Foresters, Pathfinders and Expeditions.</p><p class="Text-TextBody HoustonText" id="id2433469">Through the decades, automotive companies have tried to marry cool and function, and not just with the minivan, Norton said.</p><p class="Text-TextBody HoustonText" id="id2433499">The Dodge Coronet in the 1950s was proclaimed a "<a href="/?controllerName=search&action=search&channel=life&search=1&inlineLink=1&query=%22Glamour+Girl%22">Glamour Girl</a> ? and a Chore Boy, too." The 1958 Sunbeam Rapier was advertised as having "Sports-Car Zoom" and "Family-Car Room."</p><p class="Text-TextBody HoustonText" id="id2433504">These days, one of the difficulties with minivans is falling sales.</p><p class="Text-TextBody HoustonText" id="id2433533">In the first five years of the minivan, sales for Chrysler boomed to 474,047, from 209,895, according to company records. But all minivan sales peaked in 2000, said <a href="/?controllerName=search&action=search&channel=life&search=1&inlineLink=1&query=%22David+Zoia%22">David Zoia</a>, editorial director of WardsAuto.com, an automobile trade publication based in Michigan.</p><p class="Text-TextBody HoustonText" id="id2433568">That year, automobile makers sold more than 1.2 million minivans. Last year, sales were down to about 424,007, though 2009 was a particularly bad year for automobile sales in general, Zoia said.</p><p class="Text-TextBody HoustonText" id="id2433574">At the same time, auto makers have started introducing crossover vehicles, meant to be a little bit SUV-rugged and a little bit station-wagon-functional.</p><p class="Text-TextBody HoustonText" id="id2433579">The station wagon may also be making a comeback. In the first part of 2011, <a href="/?controllerName=search&action=search&channel=life&search=1&inlineLink=1&query=%22Acura%22">Acura</a> plans to introduce the TSX station wagon, for example.</p><p class="Text-TextBody HoustonText" id="id2433584">Lucsko does not envision the end of the minivan.</p><p class="Text-TextBody HoustonText" id="id2433587">"The minivan has the potential to become more important here," he said.</p><p class="Text-TextBody HoustonText" id="id2433591">"The question is: Can car companies make them cool again?"</p><p class="Taglines,Signers,Etc.-Signer Italic HoustonText" id="id2433645"><em class="Taglines,Signers,Etc.-Signer Italic HoustonText"><a href="mailto:tara.dooley@chron.com">tara.dooley@chron.com</a></em></p>
